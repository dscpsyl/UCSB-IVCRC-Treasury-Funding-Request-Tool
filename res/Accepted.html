	Hi [recipientName],
	<div>
		<br>
	</div>
	<div>Congratulations! IVCRC has approved $[fundedAmount] in funding to [organizaitonRequested] for [projectName].
	</div>
	<div>
		<br>
	</div>
	<div>But before we get Associated Students to send the funding, we need just a bit more information:
	</div>
	<div>
		<ol>
			<li style="padding-bottom:0.6001em">Who/what to make the check payable to and an address to mail the check to (If you are a UCSB AS organization, please ignore step two and please provide your AS account number).
			</li>
			<li style="padding-bottom:0.6001em">Whether you’d like to have the check picked up or mailed.
			</li>
			<ul>
				<li style="padding-bottom:0.6001em">If you’d like someone to pick up the check, please specify the name of the person who will be doing so. You should receive a call to pick up the check at the Associated Students Ticket Office when ready.
				</li>
				<li style="padding-bottom:0.6001em">If you’d like to have the check mailed, keep an eye out for it in your mailbox.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li style="padding-bottom:0.6001em">A filled-out <a href="[refLink]">[Funding Agreement]</a>, which goes over basic information like documentation of expenditures.<br></li></ol>Additionally, please fill out the follow-up report linked in the agreement by the date also mentioned in the funding agreement and email it back to us. We’ll send a reminder to fill this out a week before the end date.

		<div>For both the Funding Agreement and the Follow-up Report, we recommend using a digital PDF signature service, such as DocHub, so that you don’t have to print or scan anything. For steps on how to connect DocHub to Google Drive, see&nbsp;<a href="https://helpdesk.dochub.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019036733-Connect-DocHub-to-your-Google-Drive" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://helpdesk.dochub.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019036733-Connect-DocHub-to-your-Google-Drive&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1650677241665000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3fJ7HVVzCASQOyirxOYuGj">this help article</a>.

			For all promotional material, we have a handy publicity resources page for logos and icons. <a href="https://ivcrc.as.ucsb.edu/publicity-packet/">Find it here!</a>
		</div>
		<div>
			<br>
		</div>
		<div>That’s all. Thank you and have a nice day! You’re more than welcome to come back in the future for more funding, and please don’t hesitate to get back to me with any questions you might have.
